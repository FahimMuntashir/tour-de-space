Project Title: Tour De Space

High Level Project Summary:
.We attempted to create an interactive web application for younger people, with the goal of inspiring them to gain a deeper understanding of Planetary Tourism  through a gaming feature deployed in a web application. This contains different levels which include various areas of the moon which can be explored within a given time.The game also includes testing features like MCQ where the user can be promoted to the next level only if they can answer the question correctly, else they will continue exploring at their current location. The prototype used the 3D model of MARS Gale Crater, MARS Rover Curiosity and Copernicus Lunar Crater from NASA. The model is rendered with a 3x vertical exaggeration. They will gradually get familiar with Planetary Tourism and be able to experience the tour through the game and eventually they will learn more about both of these topics. Increasing the level of commitment and interest shown by the audience may result in more significant ideas & breakthroughs that will beautify the forthcoming research days on this industry.

 DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

The project is a creative and engaging way to educate people about planetary tourism and space exploration. 
How We Addressed the Challenge

We designed an interactive system that provides an interactive platform for children to grasp the concept of the solar system. This solution transcends mere gaming or visiting an interactive website; it serves as an educational resource, visually representing planets and their moons.

The website features an interactive solar system where the user can interact with the planets and gain access to their information. 

In the game the player can explore a certain planet and moon for a limited amount of time.
.
After that the player will be redirected to a MCQ quiz. Passing the quiz will unlock the next planet or moon.


Using gamification to educate younger audiences is a brilliant approach. Gamification has been proven to enhance engagement and learning. By creating a game that revolves around exploring different areas of the moon and Mars, we are trying to make learning about planetary tourism fun and interactive.

Copernicus Crater

One of the more prominent craters on the Moon is named Copernicus. Copernicus is a large young crater visible with binoculars slightly northwest of the center of the Moon's Earth-facing hemisphere. Copernicus is distinguished by its size and by the many bright rays pointing out from it. Although Copernicus is relatively young for a lunar crater, it was formed nearly a billion years ago by a colossal impact. The center of Copernicus is about 93 kilometers across. This model is rendered with a 3x vertical exaggeration.

HACKATHON JOURNEY:

We are a bunch of zealots that are dedicated to the concept of consistently getting better as well as coming up with innovative ideas. In times of difficulty, the only silver lining we can see is an opening for personal growth as well as development. We are idealists that believe in expanding our thinking even farther till we get at the goal that we have established for ourselves. For this reason, we have set ourselves the goal of becoming world champions by winning the NASA Space Apps Challenge in 2023. Moreover, it would appear that we have arrived at the realization that our commitment to teamwork may in fact result in the generation of new ideas. Because of this, we were able to advance our position. However, the first thing that we did in this procedure was conduct an analysis of the challenges in order to establish which ones may be made better by utilizing the most recent technology advancements. After that, after some debating amongst ourselves as a team, we decided to go with the concept that ended up being the most fruitful. Besides, we would like to express our sincere gratitude to Bangladesh Association of Software & Information Services (BASIS) not only for the fact that they hosted the Space Apps Bangladesh round but also for the important mentoring as well as assistance they offered throughout the project. In addition, we would like to say ‘thank you’ from the bottom of our hearts!
